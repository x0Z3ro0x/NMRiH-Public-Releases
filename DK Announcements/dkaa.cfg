// 'dkaa_random_msg' is for setting the plugin to either random or controlled mode. In random mode, the plugin will announce
// your messages randomly. In controlled it will go from your first message to your last message and then repeat from the
// beginning. 0 = controlled mode. 1 = random mode. Default is 0.

// 'dkaa_num_of_msg' is for setting the number of messages you want to display on the server. Coding is zero indexed, meaning
// counting starts at 0, not 1. If you enter 2, then 3 messages are expected because you start with 0, and continue from there
// 1, 2, totaling 3 messages. Currently you can only send up to 3 auto messages. This will change in the future to unlimted.
